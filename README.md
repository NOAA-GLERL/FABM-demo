# FABM demonstration

This repository offers guidance for getting started with [FABM](https://github.com/fabm-model/fabm). The ultimate goal is to develop a linked [FVCOM](http://fvcom.smast.umassd.edu/fvcom/)-[ERSEM](https://www.pml.ac.uk/Modelling_at_PML/Models/ERSEM) model for Lake Erie. Enroute to achieving this goal there will be opportunities to explore other hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model systems of increasing complexity.

Coarse instructions, example configuration files, and sample data files are provided. The associated [FABM-demo wiki](https://github.com/NOAA-GLERL/FABM-demo/wiki) provides details on model software configuration, installation, and use. The wiki will be expanded as more information is gathered. 

Much of the information and many of the resources provided here have been borrowed, rearranged, repackaged, co-opted, or copied from the developers of FABM and related models. I have done my best to provide credit and links to source materials where possible.

Happy FABM-ing!!!
