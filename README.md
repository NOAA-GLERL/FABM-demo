This repository offers guidance for getting started with [FABM](https://github.com/fabm-model/fabm). The ultimate goal is to develop a Lake Erie ERSEM-FVCOM model. Enroute to achiving this goal there will be opportunities to explore other biogeochemical-hydrodynamic model systems of increasing complexity.

Coarse instructions, example configuration files, and sample data files are provided. The associated [wiki pages](https://github.com/NOAA-GLERL/FABM-tutorial/wiki) provide details on model software configuration, installation, and use. The wiki will be expanded as more information is gathered. 

Much of the information and many of the resources provided here have been borrowed, rearranged, repackaged, co-opted, or copied from the developers of FABM and related models. I have done my best to provide credit and links to source materials where possible.

Happy FABM-ing!!!
